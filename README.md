##The challenge
The challenge is to build out this clock application and get it looking as close to the design as possible using following APIs to retrieve the necessary data:

World Time API to set the time based on the visitor's IP adress. This API will also be used for additional data, like the day of the year shown in the expanded state.
IP Geolocation API to set the city and country underneath the time
Quotes API to generate random quotes.

User stories
Users should be able to:

View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
View the current time and location information based on their IP address
View additional information about the date and time in the expanded state
Be shown the correct greeting and background image based on the time of day they're visiting the site
Generate random programming quotes by clicking the refresh icon near the quote
##
##Expected Behavior
The greeting changes depending on the time of day. It should say:
"Good morning" between 5am and 12pm
"Good afternoon" between 12pm and 6pm
"Good evening" between 6pm and 5am
The greeting icon and background image also changes depending on the time of day. They should show:
The sun icon and the daytime background image between 5am and 6pm
The moon icon and the nighttime background image between 6pm and 5am
Generate a new random quote whenever the refresh icon is clicked
