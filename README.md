##Clock App
The Clock App is a React-based web application built using TypeScript and styled-components. This app provides a simple yet powerful interface for displaying the current time, along with the user's local time, based on their geolocation and timezone. Additionally, it fetches an inspirational quote from an external API every time the web page renders or when the user presses the refresh button. The app also changes its background picture depending on whether it's night or day.
